## About

Bookr is my first attempt at Web Developing at HRB's Up Academy Java Starter Course. 
This project is a Tinder-like website that allows an user to search, like and get information on their favourite books and authors.

## Website Applications

Bookr was created using HTML5 Bootstrap, CSS3 and Javascript JQuery, with code version control in gitHub and continuous integration in Heroku.

## Acessing the Website

The website can be acessed by using the following URL:
https://upacademybookr.herokuapp.com/Goncalo%20Forjaz%20(Bootstrap).html

A change to index.html will soon follow.

## API

The website uses the Google Books APIs to retrieve Google Book Volumes based on the user's search input.

## Contributors

Bookr is developed and maintained by Gonçalo Forjaz.

## Thanks

I would like to thank the HRB staff for providing this opportunity, Marco Mendão for teaching me the fundamentals about Web Developing, and my colleagues at Up Academy for their companionship and support.
